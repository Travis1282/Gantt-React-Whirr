## What it is 
Whirr is a project management tool that helps managers plan large projects, interact with their employees to acomplish their goals and manage their time. 

## What's it made of?
It's built with React and uses reactvis and react-vis-timeline to display projects on a timeline. 

## What's the plan?
The larger goal is to impliment an app that will allow for interactions between tasks, creating timeline dependencies so that when one project's timeline changes all of it's dependents are updated.
